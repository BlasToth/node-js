# Introduction to Express.js
## Assignment 2 (Routing)

1. Create a npm project and install Express.js (Nodemon - optional)
2. Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response
3. Handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request has only one handler/middleware doing something with it (e.g. send dummy response)
